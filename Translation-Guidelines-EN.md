## PURPOSE AND FOCUS OF TRANSLATION

The purpose of this work is to provide an accurate translation of the evolving beta version of the Holacracy Constitution 5.0 available at https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution.

The Constitution itself is accompanied by other supporting documents (e.g. the Constitution Adoption Declaration) that are all available on GitHub at https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution

## TRANSLATION PROCESS

Each target language has a **Translation Steward** with final authority to accept or reject translation updates. Other contributors may submit changes by *committing* them to the repository, and the Translation Steward will accept or reject the changes.

If you believe another person would clearly be a better fit to be Translation Steward for a target language (including yourself), please <a href="http://holacracy.org/contact" target="_blank">contact HolacracyOne</a>.
